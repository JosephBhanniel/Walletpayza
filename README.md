# WalletPayza

WalletPayza is a Laravel-based wallet application that enables seamless management of company and employee wallets.
The platform empowers companies to load cash into their main wallet and transfer funds to any wallet within the system.
Employees can conveniently request cash and perform withdrawals, while a Super Admin role oversees and regulates all platform activities.
